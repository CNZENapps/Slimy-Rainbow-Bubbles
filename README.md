It’s **not a game**, but an **interactive art experience** where:

* You **drag your mouse** (or finger on a touchscreen) across the screen.
* As you drag, the screen fills with:

  * **Slimy rainbow-colored bubbles**
  * **Colorful lines** connecting them in a squishy, stretchy, almost jelly-like effect.

It’s kind of like **digital slime meets rainbow soap bubbles**. 🎨✨
